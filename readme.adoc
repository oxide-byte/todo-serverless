= Todo Serverless

== WARNING

image::.readme-resources/aws_ec2_joke.jpeg[]

This project is deployed on the AWS Cloud and like each Cloud service it could generate costs. Even when parts are covered by the https://aws.amazon.com/free/[AWS Free Tier] it is your responsibility to evaluate and survey costs that also may change over time.

While reading different documentations and forums, the following hint I found useful:

- Consider to use 2 way authenticated. (Be aware, hacker could use your account for example for crypto mining and generate high costs).

- Consider not to use your root account as working user, but to create a second account.

- Consider to create a Budget plan, even only to 1â‚¬, and receive a [NOTIFICATION-MAIL] when the limit is reached.

- Consider to remove all resources not needed or created for testing.

== Content

This project contains a POC implementation for an Serverless application. The following elements could be found in the project


* Makefile : scripts building and deploying the application

* SAM (template.yaml) containing the Cloud Formation definition for the AWS Serverless environment. it deploys

** 5 Lambda Functions build on Rust for the different GET/PUT/POST/DELETE operations

** A DynamoBB storing the data for the application

** An S3 Bucket with public access containing a static Web Site build on Leptos

** A CloudWatch group containing the logs of the application

** Api Gateway for CORS, Policies, Usage Plan,... to configure the elements

== Requirement

For deploying the application we need:

* an AWS account

* an AWS User with programmatic Access Keys for SAM.

* AWS SAM configured with the Access Keys for deploying the application

* a Rust development environment as the functions are build on Rust (Rust compiler and cargo)

* Trunk (WASM) for building the Rust Leptos Frontend

* A critical and open mind :smile: Don't simply copy/paste, this code it is more for inspiration and showcase. It works (on my pc :grin:)

== Deployment

The deployment is partially automated, this due the SAM that manages the serverless application and the scripts prepared in the Makefile.

Here the steps:

1) Modifying in the template.yaml file the bucket name. It must be unique on the cloud:

```
  S3Bucket:
    Type: AWS::S3::Bucket
    DeletionPolicy: Delete
    Properties:
      # REPLACE THIS NAME BY YOUR OWN BUCKET NAME !!!
      # APPLY ALSO THE NAME IN THE MAKE SCRIPT:
      #   aws s3 cp ./todo_ui/dist s3://todo-app-demo1/ --recursive
      BucketName: todo-app-demo1
```

2) From Makefile the step: api

it compiles the lambda functions and deploys it to AWS with creating and configuring the AWS Serverless application, including Bucket and DynamoDB

3) On the end you get in the output the URL for the Lambda function. !!! ATTENTION !!! these entry points are public. So ANYBODY could, when known sent requests on it. The TodoUsagePlan and CORS would be some of the elements to consider for reducing risks.

CloudFormation outputs from deployed stack
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Outputs
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Key                 TodoBucketUrl
Description         S3 Bucket URL:
Value               https://XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX.s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com

Key                 TodoGetListFunctionAPI
Description         API [get-todos] URL:
Value               https://ecfi31myyc.execute-api.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/Prod/get-todos
```

The points could already be used by CURL or in the folder http some scripts, if you use IntelliJ Ultimate.

4) Before building the Frontend, we need to modify the URL on to access on the API entry points. In todo_ui/src/components/todo_service.rs replace the URL:

```
TodoService {
    url: "https://4iua3wx06j.execute-api.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/Prod/".to_string()
}
```

Also replace in the Makefile the Bucket for publishing the static files:

```
STACK_NAME ?= todo-app
FUNCTIONS := get-todos
BUCKET_NAME := todo-demo-xxx
```

5) From the Makefile you can now executing the step: ui that build and deploys the web components in the S3 Bucket. !!! ATTENTION !!!The same here, the URL is public accessible.

6) Accessing the application from the Bucket URL, you find it in the logs of the SAM deployment (https://XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX.s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com)

*CLEAN UP*

When you are finished, you can remove the resources with the step clean in Makefile. Validate the logs, and ensure that all resources have been deleted in connecting to the AWS console.
